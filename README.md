# AAF Family DCH Audio
- [X] Compatibility

This driver package is supported in Windows 10 & Windows 11.

**ATTENTION:** Windows 11 24H2 is experiencing a lot of bugs related to audio in general. At this time, I do not recommend this version.

Only Realtek ALC Audio Chips (HDA and Intel SST) are supported.

Realtek USB Audio Chips are not supported at this moment.

When you remove this driver package, everything that was selected at the time of installation will be removed.

- [X] Purpose of this project

Help those who have a motherboard with a Realtek audio chip and who want to extract superior audio quality in music, movies, games or other content.

I hope to be able to help all internet users interested in these packages.
