# AAF Family DCH Audio
- [X] Compatibility

This driver package is supported in Windows 10 & Windows 11.

**ATTENTION:** Windows 11 24H2 is experiencing a lot of bugs related to audio in general. At this time, I do not recommend this version.

Only Realtek ALC Audio Chips (HDA and Intel SST*) are supported.

Realtek USB Audio Chips are not supported at this moment.

When you remove this driver package, everything that was selected at the time of installation will be removed.

- [X] Purpose of this project

Help those who have a motherboard with a Realtek audio chip and who want to extract superior audio quality in music, movies, games or other content.

I hope to be able to help all internet users interested in these packages.

*Some people may still have issues with Intel SST, depending on their hardware and the features it offers. Given this, I recommend that you install the AAF Bus Driver, but first, you will need to uninstall any remnants of the Intel SST driver present on your system.
